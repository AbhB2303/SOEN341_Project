## Project Summary
For our project, we wanted to keep in mind the user.  Freedom of speech is very important for us as a species so we made a website to post 
all your questions and have anyone respond.  We, as a team, wanted to bring people together and allow for 
everyone to learn from each other by asking all these questions and everyone giving 
unique feedback for everyone's burning questions.  Sometimes, sites such as these will delete questions
that are left after a few months but with our database, we will be able to keep all these questions for years to come so that people from all generations 
can come and see if the questions they want to ask have already been asked.  That is why, we have made AskAway.net and starting today, you can sign up and ask away.
