## Project Summary
For our project, we wanted to keep in mind the user.  Freedom of speech is very important for us as a species so we made a website to post 
all your questions and have anyone respond.  We, as a team, wanted to bring people together and allow for 
everyone to learn from each other by asking all these questions and everyone giving 
unique feedback for everyone's burning questions.  Sometimes, sites such as these will delete questions
that are left after a few months but with our database, we will be able to keep all these questions for years to come so that people from all generations 
can come and see if the questions they want to ask have already been asked.  That is why, we have made AskAway.net and starting today, you can sign up and ask away.

## Infrastructure




Framework


For this project, the React framework was used, which utilises JavaScript. This framework was selected because it is a free and open source. Also, it was used to minimize risk since there were members of the team that were already familiar with this framework and had experience with JavaScript and Java. It was also selected because it is well documented and there are many tutorials and troubleshooting tips that are easily accessible online for any errors the team might have encountered. It is also a framework that is considered easy to adopt, that has multiple developer tools, and that can be compatible on many platforms. 

For the framework, there were many alternatives available. One of which was the .NET framework. One of the reasons this was not selected was to minimize the risk. There were no team members that were familiar with this framework, so the risk was substantial. Another reason was that the trial period for students was not long enough, so it would not be free. There were also less tutorials and less troubleshooting tips available overall, compared to the selected framework. Other options for frameworks included Spring, Ruby, and Angular. These were rejected mainly because of the lack of experience with them within the team.
